Use a doubly-linked list?
Keep track of head element and current element
Read and construct one character at a time
 -> If the next character has a reverse polarity, don't add it AND remove the previous character

Read character - Make node
Read next char
  -> Reacts ? previous node is new tail,
              don't add -- skip to "Read next char"
            : add -- new node is new tail
